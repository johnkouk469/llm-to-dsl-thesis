My smart home devices communicate with each other using my CasaStream MQTT broker.

In my bedroom I have sensors for the himidity and the the temperature of the room, an aircondition and a humidifier.
In my kitchen a gas sensor.
I want the humidifier to power on when the humidity is above 60% and then turn off when it drops the humidity below 30%.
I want the aircondition to turn on when the temperature in the room is higher than 28 degrees and the humidity is between 30% and 60%. I want it set to 25 degrees on the cool mode.
Trigger the alarm if gas levels in the kitchen deviate significantly from their usual values.
Make use of value generators.
The SmAuto runtime paremeters should be monitored.
