Set the aircondition in my bedroom to 18 degrees on the cool mode when it is already on and the enviroment temperature is above 30 degrees.
The aircondition as well as a weather station used to know the temperature, the humidity and the pressure of the house's location are connected to an MQTT broker.
The MQTT broker is the one I have running in my house on the IP 155.207.19.66 and it listens on the port 1883.
The username for the broker is johndoesmqtt and the password is HMr4%}+z;P"R.
Make use of value generators.
The SmAuto runtime paremeters should be monitored.
