### Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a SmAuto Model

Creating a SmAuto model involves defining various components such as brokers, entities, and automations. Follow these detailed steps to create a SmAuto model from scratch.

#### Components Necessary for a SmAuto Model:

1. **Broker**: Acts as the communication layer for messages, supporting MQTT, AMQP, or Redis protocols.
2. **Entity**: Represents connected smart devices that send and receive information using a broker.
3. **Automation**: Defines a set of actions to be executed when certain conditions are met.
4. **Condition**: Specifies the criteria that trigger the actions in an automation.
5. **Action**: Represents the messages sent to actuators, specifying the changes to be made when conditions are met.
6. **Metadata** (Optional): Contains meta-information about the model.
7. **RTMonitor** (Optional): Defines monitoring parameters for runtime information.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Install SmAuto**:
   - Clone the SmAuto repository and install it using pip.
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/robotics-4-all/smauto-dsl
     cd smauto-dsl
     pip install .
     ```

2. **Define a Broker**:
   - Create a broker definition to act as the communication layer.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     Broker<MQTT> home_broker
         host: "localhost"
         port: 1883
         auth:
             username: ""
             password: ""
     end
     ```
   - Properties:
     - **type**: Protocol type (MQTT, AMQP, Redis)
     - **host**: Host IP address or hostname
     - **port**: Port number
     - **auth**: Authentication credentials (username and password)

3. **Define Entities**:
   - Create entities representing the smart devices.
   - Example for a sensor:
     ```plaintext
     Entity weather_station
         type: sensor
         topic: "porch.weather_station"
         broker: home_broker
         attributes:
             - temperature: float
             - humidity: int
     end
     ```
   - Example for an actuator:
     ```plaintext
     Entity aircondition
         type: actuator
         topic: "bedroom.aircondition"
         broker: home_broker
         attributes:
             - temperature: float
             - mode: str
             - on: bool
     end
     ```
   - Properties:
     - **type**: sensor or actuator
     - **topic**: Topic in the broker to send/receive messages
     - **broker**: Reference to a previously defined broker
     - **attributes**: Set of attributes with name and type

4. **Define Automations**:
   - Create automations to specify actions to be taken when conditions are met.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     Automation start_aircondition
         condition:
             (weather_station.temperature > 32) AND
             (aircondition.on == true)
         enabled: true
         continuous: false
         actions:
             - aircondition.temperature: 25.0
             - aircondition.mode: "cool"
             - aircondition.on: true
     end
     ```
   - Properties:
     - **condition**: Criteria that trigger the actions
     - **enabled**: Whether the automation should run
     - **continuous**: Whether the automation should remain enabled after actions are executed
     - **actions**: List of actions to perform

5. **Define Conditions**:
   - Write conditions using entity attributes to specify when the actions should be executed.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     (weather_station.temperature > 32) AND (aircondition.on == true)
     ```
   - Use logical and comparison operators to combine conditions.

6. **Define Actions**:
   - Specify the actions to be performed when conditions are met.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     - aircondition.temperature: 25.0
     - aircondition.mode: "cool"
     - aircondition.on: true
     ```
   - Actions are formatted as `entity_name.attribute_name: value`.

7. **(Optional) Define Metadata**:
   - Provide meta-information about the model.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     Metadata
         name: SimpleHomeAutomation
         version: "0.1.0"
         description: "Simple home automation model."
         author: "Your Name"
         email: "your.email@example.com"
     end
     ```
   - Properties:
     - **name**: Name of the model
     - **version**: Version of the model
     - **description**: Description of the model
     - **author**: Author's name
     - **email**: Author's email

8. **(Optional) Define RTMonitor**:
   - Set monitoring parameters for runtime information.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     RTMonitor
         broker: home_broker
         namespace: "smauto.simple_home_auto"
         eventTopic: "event"
         logsTopic: "logs"
     end
     ```
   - Properties:
     - **broker**: Reference to a broker
     - **namespace**: Namespace for constructing URIs
     - **eventTopic**: Topic to send events
     - **logsTopic**: Topic to send logs

9. **Compile and Run the Model**:
   - Compile the SmAuto model into executable Python programs.
   - Use the command-line interface to generate virtual entities and automations.
     ```bash
     smauto genv model.auto
     smauto gen model.auto
     ```
   - This will generate the necessary Python code for the defined entities and automations.

By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive SmAuto model to automate tasks in a smart environment.
