### Step-by-Step Instructions for Creating a SmAuto Model

Creating a SmAuto model involves defining the various components of the smart environment, including brokers, entities, and automations. Below is a detailed guide to help you create a SmAuto model from scratch.

#### Components of a SmAuto Model:
1. **Metadata**
2. **Broker**
3. **Entity**
4. **Automation**
5. **RTMonitor (Optional)**

### Steps to Create a SmAuto Model

#### Step 1: Install SmAuto
To begin, you need to install SmAuto. You can either clone the repository and install it using pip or use the Docker image.
- **Source Installation:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/robotics-4-all/smauto-dsl
    cd smauto-dsl
    pip install .
    ```
- **Docker Image:**
    ```bash
    docker build -t smauto .
    docker run -it --rm --name mysmauto -p 8080:8080 smauto
    ```

#### Step 2: Define Metadata (Optional)
Metadata provides meta-information about your SmAuto model.
```plaintext
Metadata
    name: SimpleHomeAutomation
    version: "0.1.0"
    description: "Simple home automation model."
    author: "Your Name"
    email: "your.email@example.com"
end
```

#### Step 3: Define Brokers
Brokers act as communication layers for messages. You need at least one broker in your model.
- **Example:**
    ```plaintext
    Broker<MQTT> home_broker
        host: "localhost"
        port: 1883
        auth:
            username: ""
            password: ""
    end
    ```

#### Step 4: Define Entities
Entities are the connected smart devices in your environment. Entities can be of type `sensor` or `actuator`.
- **Example Sensor Entity:**
    ```plaintext
    Entity weather_station
        type: sensor
        topic: "porch.weather_station"
        broker: home_broker
        attributes:
            - temperature: float
            - humidity: int
        freq: 5
    end
    ```
- **Example Actuator Entity:**
    ```plaintext
    Entity aircondition
        type: actuator
        topic: "bedroom.aircondition"
        broker: home_broker
        attributes:
            - temperature: float
            - mode: str
            - on: bool
    end
    ```

#### Step 5: Define Automations
Automations define the logic for interacting with entities based on conditions.
- **Example:**
    ```plaintext
    Automation start_aircondition
        condition:
            (weather_station.temperature > 32) AND
            (aircondition.on is true)
        enabled: true
        continuous: false
        actions:
            - aircondition.temperature:  25.0
            - aircondition.mode:  "cool"
            - aircondition.on:  true
    end
    ```

#### Step 6: Define RTMonitor (Optional)
RTMonitor is used to define monitoring parameters of the SmAuto runtime.
- **Example:**
    ```plaintext
    RTMonitor
        broker: home_broker
        namespace: "smauto.simple_home_auto"
        eventTopic: "event"
        logsTopic: "logs"
    end
    ```

### Example Model
Here is a complete example of a SmAuto model combining the above definitions:
```plaintext
Metadata
    name: SimpleHomeAutomation
    version: "0.1.0"
    description: "Simple home automation model."
    author: "Your Name"
    email: "your.email@example.com"
end

Broker<MQTT> home_broker
    host: "localhost"
    port: 1883
    auth:
        username: ""
        password: ""
end

Entity weather_station
    type: sensor
    topic: "porch.weather_station"
    broker: home_broker
    attributes:
        - temperature: float
        - humidity: int
    freq: 5
end

Entity aircondition
    type: actuator
    topic: "bedroom.aircondition"
    broker: home_broker
    attributes:
        - temperature: float
        - mode: str
        - on: bool
end

Automation start_aircondition
    condition:
        (weather_station.temperature > 32) AND
        (aircondition.on is true)
    enabled: true
    continuous: false
    actions:
        - aircondition.temperature:  25.0
        - aircondition.mode:  "cool"
        - aircondition.on:  true
end

RTMonitor
    broker: home_broker
    namespace: "smauto.simple_home_auto"
    eventTopic: "event"
    logsTopic: "logs"
end
```

### Step 7: Validate and Compile the Model
After defining your model, you need to validate and compile it.
- **Validation:**
    ```bash
    smauto validate model.auto
    ```
- **Compile Automations:**
    ```bash
    smauto gen model.auto
    ```
- **Compile Virtual Entities:**
    ```bash
    smauto genv model.auto
    ```

### Step 8: Generate Visualization Graphs (Optional)
You can also generate visualization graphs of your automations.
- **Generate Graphs:**
    ```bash
    smauto graph model.auto
    ```

By following these steps, you should be able to create a comprehensive SmAuto model for your smart environment.
