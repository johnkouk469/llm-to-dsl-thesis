# LLM-to-DSL-Thesis

This repository contains the source code for my integrated master's thesis:  
**"Generating Domain-Specific Language (DSL) Models from Natural Language Descriptions using Large Language Models (LLMs)"**.

The system allows users to generate valid models in two DSLs using natural language descriptions:
- **SmAuto** ‚Äî for smart home automation.
- **dFlow** ‚Äî for dialogue-based assistant logic.

Model generation is powered by GPT-based LLMs (via OpenAI API), while model validation is performed through locally hosted REST APIs for each DSL.

---

## üöÄ How to Run

To generate models from user input, run one of the following Python scripts:

- `llm_to_smauto.py` ‚Äî generates a **SmAuto** model.
- `llm_to_dflow.py` ‚Äî generates a **dFlow** model.

Each script:
1. Accepts a natural language description from the user.
2. Sends a prompt to the LLM (GPT-4).
3. Receives and saves the generated DSL model.
4. Sends the model to a local validation API.
5. If the model is invalid, triggers a correction loop using GPT.

## üîå Validator Requirements

To validate the generated models:

- The REST API for **SmAuto** and **dFlow** must be running locally at:
http://localhost:8080

- If needed, you can change the URL endpoints in:
- `smauto_api.py` (for SmAuto)
- `dflow_api.py` (for dFlow)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If the API is not running or unreachable, the validation process will fail.

## üîê Environment Variables

The application requires certain API keys to function properly. These are provided in a `.env` file placed in the project‚Äôs root directory.

Here‚Äôs an example of the required `.env` file:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-******"
SMAUTO_API_KEY="API_KEY"
DFLOW_API_KEY="123"
```

### Default Keys
If you‚Äôre using the default local REST API setup for validation:

The default SmAuto API key is: API_KEY

The default dFlow API key is: 123

These values can be customized if you configure your validator servers differently.
