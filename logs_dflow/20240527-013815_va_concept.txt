**Virtual Assistant Concept: "Health Navigator"**

**Purpose:**
The Health Navigator is a virtual assistant designed to provide users with comprehensive healthcare management and assistance. Its primary purpose is to help users manage their health-related tasks, access medical information, schedule appointments, and receive timely reminders for medication. The assistant aims to simplify healthcare interactions and provide personalized support to users, ensuring they stay on top of their health needs.

**Target Users:**
The Health Navigator is targeted at individuals of all ages who need assistance with managing their health and wellness. This includes patients with chronic conditions, elderly individuals requiring medication reminders, busy professionals needing appointment scheduling, and anyone interested in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

**Key Features:**
